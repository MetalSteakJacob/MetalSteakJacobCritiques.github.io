## Game Critiques

### *Game Critique 9/21*

Space Fighter is an online, PC game where you play as a space ship orbiting around a moon or asteroid from what it looks like. You fly around and shoot down other players with lazer bullets or missiles. You can also choose different ships.

Almost everything is wrong with the game, it may just be my computer, but I don't find it to be playable. I had to lower the quality of the graphics and sounds, and turn off some special effects in order to see where i was going.

The music seems to be a playlist of different space themed music but there's a long minute pause between each song. the sound effects are off by half a second when you shoot lazers out the ship.

Playing the game itself can leave you hanging a lot. There are no directions on what button does what, and you don't even know you're playing against other people until the match ends and see the scoreboard. By that, I mean when you start the game, it just starts. There's no countdown or "match start" or any sort of information on what you're doing. I've also found that when you go out of bounds, you can see the end of the world itself. It's too obvious to see that the floor is just a small plane with grey space underneath.

There's a special missile you use, and when you launch it, you play as it to guide it to the target, but your ship is still flying so it can still get shot or crash. I was later able to find the controls but when you exit it and go back to the menu, it's blank. It still has the background and music but there's no "start" or "options" so i was left to guess "okay, maybe i should press space"  then the actual menu comes up. I was able to find that it only happens when you're on the controls menu for too long.

Also I tried playing as the other types of ships. They all look different, but when you click on one, you're still left with the default ship.

### *Game Critique 9/26*

"You Doesn't Exist" I found this title to be really odd for a medieval rpg game. At first it reminded me of pokemon. You wake up from a bed, go downstairs to meet your mom, and go out to the world. But when it came to the fighting, it took me a while to understand it, and I had a hard time reading everything because the battle menu was on the bottom of the screen, while the narration was on the top. I got the hang of it later and actually enjoyed playing it.
After playing it for a little longer now, I found out it's not a medieval game at all. This game confuses the player by constantly changing the setting of the game. First im in a medieval world, killing dragons, then it turns out I'm a kid playing on the computer, who also happens to be simulation of someone in the future, sleeping in a dream pod. The loop goes on and I still don't know whats really going on. But the reason why this is important is because the quality of the game changes as well, but it's hard to tell if these bugs were on purpose or not. The only thing I found that I know is a bug is if you spam the directional buttons, the character will spin in a circle for about a full second. There was also a part where I died and the menu changed to where some selections were missing, but I'm not sure if that was part of the game because dying plays a part in the plot as well. The game is basically several games in one, and you have to play each of them a certain way to go to another game. So I'm thinking a good test would be to go through the loop of games several times until you mess up the whole thing, which I think is highly possible, considering the loop of games is completely random and the puzzles are so specific to move to the next game.

# Synopsis
The game is strange. I think it's supposed to be based off a band. So far it's super slow but seems easy to play.

# Game Play Summary
The game play is awful. There are no directions except for random useless quotes, floating in the air. You don't have a real chance, especially if you're a beginner, because enemies come from odd angles while your attacks are too slow and don't align to where the enemies will be, making them almost usless. The only attack that's effective is when you press the S key, it does and area damage attack, but it's slow so you have to time it.
## Playability
Like I've said about the attacks. They don't align with the enemy positions. They are alwasy too low, too high, or just too fast. The game itself is slow, so it throws off your reaction time. When it comes to jumping, it feels like you have to solve an algebra equation, because you have to time it just right. Why do you have to time yur jumps? Because There's fire under you, and the fire's sprite is too big, so you have to jump right over the corner of it, and still have to move fast enough before the platform falls into the fire after you had just jumped over it. It's one of those games where it's a little confusing and hard at the first level, but then bullies you at the second, while the third, which is also the boss battle, is impossible.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single
### Controls
The button choices are the worst. The positions of the buttons do not coordinate with the direction of the attacks at all. Why does D do a diagonal laser? Why does E teleport? Why is F forward attack? Forward attack should be D, teleport should be SHIFT + directional button, and the diagonal laser shouldn't even exist because it's too precise.
# Bugs
From the beginning you choose a character, I assume they are the band members, on a screen where each character is standing, while above them is a picture of the real person. I tried clicking on the character and found out you have to click on the picture of the real guy, not the character that's in the game. Then I decided to change character, but I can't. Once you click on one, that's it. You have no choice but to click start, or restart the entire game.
# Final Thoughts
Needs work on the menu. The levels need rearranging on enemies and fire. The game's script needs cleaning, because it's way too slow for it's quality. It's too obvious they have more lines than needed.
